		<h2 class="is-heading u-text-medium">Treatment For Cataracts</h2>
		<p>In the early stages of a cataract, an updated eyeglasses or contact lens prescription may compensate for any visual deterioration. However, this approach does not cure the condition and as a cataract progresses, an increased prescription will no longer be adequate. Cataracts will eventually affect your ability to safely perform everyday tasks, such as driving and cooking, as well as prevent you from enjoying hobbies such as reading, sewing, exercising, art, or gardening. The only effective treatment for cataracts is surgery.</p>

		<h2 class="is-heading u-text-medium">Cataract Surgery Recovery</h2>
		<p>Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure and does not require an overnight hospital stay. Cataract surgery patients generally experience very little downtime, and vision is typically noticeably improved by the next day and continues to improve for several weeks. The majority of patients are back to their regular activities and even driving within 24-48 hours after surgery. Patients will need to take a regimen of prescription drops to help prevent infection and regulate healing for several weeks after surgery, and your eye doctor will review post-operative care instructions with you.</p>
